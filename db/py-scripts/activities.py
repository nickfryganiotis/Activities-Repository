They usually have a narrow vision of themselves or the person they might wish to become (e.g., to be liked by others, to have a particular job, or expectations of an idealized future). There is also wide variability in peopleâ€™s beliefs about what they can change or how easy it will be to make changes. Students are challenged to describe themselves 20 years in the future as part of a writing assignment. Students are then asked to describe the details of their life at this future point. Using the 4 MAT method (experiential learning), they are invited to represent the essential choices and actions they would have made to reach this future self. The teacher can invite the other students to express their positive thoughts about their colleagues` goal, the obstacles that can impact their purpose, the strategies to overcome obstacles in an assertive manner."
